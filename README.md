I'm a Junior Cloud & Automation Engineer focused on simplifying cloud infrastructure with Python, AWS, and automation tools. I build scripts and tools that reduce costs, improve visibility, and make operations more efficient.

Always learning. Always building. Open to roles in cloud, DevOps, or backend automation.
